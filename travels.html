						<h3 id="head3">Norway with the Fujifilm GFX</h3>
						<p class="part"><em><b>Ken Kaminesky</b></em> - Discovering Norway with the Fujifilm GFX In February of this year, I had the distinct pleasure of visiting and exploring beautiful Lofoten Norway on a scouting trip with Discovery Photo Tours. We are planning to run a photography tour there in 2018 and had to get our boots on the ground to find the best. Well above the Arctic circle, Lofoten is a true winter wonderland and yet is not nearly as cold as one would imagine being so far up north. With a bit of luck, we had ample snowfall during our trip and that allowed us to get some incredible images of mountains, seashores, and villages. I’m posting a few images here but you can see even more of my GFX Norway photos in the GFX review.</p>
						<p class="part">It wasn’t until I got home that I saw just how crisp these images are. yes, there are other 50 megapixel cameras out there but you’ll either be sacrificing a lot of quality, dynamic range and get much more noise with a 50 mp DSLR. If you’re comparing this camera to the other medium format cameras, don’t… your wallet will thank you. Just compare the pricing of the Fujifilm GFX with a comparable Hasselblad or Phase One and you’ll see what I’m talking about. The good thing is that you’re not sacrificing quality for a much lower price point. This is a revolutionary camera.<br /><br />

					<h3 id="head3">Best Camera For Travel 2017</h3>
						<p class="part"><em><b>Alesha And Jarryd</b></em> - The first thing you will need to do is decide what your goals are with your travel photography. Do you just want to get some snaps to look back at now and then and maybe upload them to social media? Are you going to try and document as much of your trip as possible? Keen on video? Thinking about getting serious and taking your photography to the next level?<p/>
						<p class="part">It’s totally up to you. But one thing we will say is that once you start capturing some great photos and learning about the basics of travel photography, it gets very addictive.</p>
						<p class="part">Remember, if you think that perhaps one day you will really get into photography it can sometimes be better to get a camera that is better so you can grow into it. Rather than buying a new camera every trip, save money in the long run by spending a bit more of your budget upfront.</p>
						<p class="part">On the other hand, there’s no point buying the best camera for travel photography if you’re never going to use it to its full potential. Only you will know whether it is something you are going to want to pursue later down the track.

						<p class="part"><em><b>Hana Lê Van</b></em> - Even though we didn’t have particularly much free time while in Los Angeles, we certainly tried to make the most out the little time we had. As I had never been to California before (and neither had my wonderful photography assistant Hana) we wanted to discover as much as possible before it was time to fly off to the next adventure. We certainly didn’t manage to see everything that we wanted to see (I totally underestimated the size of Los Angeles, haha) but we did manage to see a couple of the things on our list.</p>

						<p class="part">Obviously, as you can see, In-N-Out Burger was one of the main priorities. Ice creams and strolls around Venice Beach, driving around Beverly Hills, watching the sunset in Malibu, running along the beach in Santa Monica, seeing a little part of Hollywood and a dinner at Chateau Marmont were also ticked off my list during out time! I know, I know, there’s a million things left that we haven’t seen yet but all the more reason to come back one day, no?<br /><br />
