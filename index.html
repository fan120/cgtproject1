				<p>The third of the HERO3+ Adventure Series</p>
				
				<p class="part">Imagine never having to worry about framing your subject…ever. Yes, cameras do the heavy lifting already, but it still takes the eye to compose a shot, right? Well, thanks to Fusion, our users will be able to record their moments in all directions and then go back and choose the composition they want. This is referred to as OverCapture or reframing. It’s like having a camera team with you when you shoot capturing your primary and b-roll footage. From there, you have the flexibility in post-production to pick and share all sides of your story in conventional HD.</p>
				<p class="part">As the Senior Product Manager for Fusion, I have been looking forward to this day for some time. We have a pilot program starting soon, and I cannot wait to see how innovative content creators will use Fusion to help them tell their stories. The goal of Fusion is to distill the best of GoPro—quality, mountability and durability—into a pocketable product that will wow our professional customers.</p>
				<p class="part">True to its name, Fusion has been a multi-team effort, and it has been amazing to work alongside incredibly talented teams to dream up a product that we feel will both address pain points as well as unlock the creativity of GoPro’s vast network of professional content creators, partners and enthusiasts.</p>
				<p class="part">Today, we officially let the cat out of the bag with a press release to the public. Have a read below. I hope you are as excited as I am about Fusion. It’s been a labor of love, and we hope you all have as much fun using it and experiencing its content as we did designing it.</p>
